##  Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for my **IBM DevOps Capstone Project**, developed as part of the  
[IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/devops-and-software-engineering).  
It demonstrates a fully automated CI/CD workflow using **GitHub Actions**, **Tekton Pipelines**, and **OpenShift**, following **TDD** principles.

---

##  Usage Instructions

This project is meant to be cloned and extended.  
>  **Do not fork** — Instead, click the `Use this Template` button on GitHub to create your own copy.

---

##  Dev Environment Setup (IBM Cloud IDE)

Use the Skills Network Labs IDE provided in the Coursera labs. Initialize the environment with:

```bash
source bin/setup.sh
```

This will:
- Install Python 3.9
- Configure your environment
- Set up and activate the virtual environment

Prompt should now look like:
```bash
(venv) theia:project$
```

---

##  Useful Commands

### Activate the Python venv
```bash
source ~/venv/bin/activate
```

### Reinstall dependencies (if needed)
```bash
make install
```

### Start PostgreSQL container
```bash
make db
```
