This repository contains a final project that demonstrates a complete **Cloud-Native CI/CD** pipeline  
with a strong emphasis on software quality through **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and  
**Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** practices.

> Built using **Python**, deployed using modern DevOps practices  
> in a microservice architecture inspired by production-level workflows.
>
> **Created by Guy Landry Djolaud** â€” DevOps Architect focused on Cloud, Automation, and Containerization.

## Key Features

- Python microservice using Flask & PostgreSQL
- RESTful API built with MVC design pattern
- Unit tests with `pytest` ensuring >95% code coverage
- Tekton pipelines for CI/CD orchestration
- Docker containerization & Kubernetes manifests
- YAML-based IaC with reusable templates

---

## Dev Environment Setup

This was developed in the IBM Skills Network Cloud IDE with OpenShift. To recreate the environment locally:

```bash
source bin/setup.sh
```

This initializes:
- Python 3.9 with `venv`
- Virtual environment activation
- CLI prompts for DevOps workflow

Activate environment:

```bash
source ~/venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

Run PostgreSQL container:

```bash
make db
```

## Local Kubernetes Simulation

To replicate the IBM Cloud IDE locally:

```bash
make cluster      # Start K3D cluster
make tekton       # Install Tekton
make clustertasks # Add IBMâ€™s ClusterTasks
```

Use Docker Desktop + VS Code + Remote Containers for full local experience.
