This repository presents a complete DevOps pipeline for a Python-based microservice, built using **Tekton**, **Docker**, and **OpenShift**. Developed as part of the [IBM DevOps Capstone Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/devops-capstone-project?specialization=devops-and-software-engineering), it demonstrates cloud-native CI/CD automation practices.

>  Created by **Guy Landry Djolaud** â€“ DevOps Architect passionate about Cloud, CI/CD, Automation & Containerization.

## Key Features

- Python microservice using Flask & PostgreSQL
- RESTful API built with MVC design pattern
- Unit tests with `pytest` ensuring >95% code coverage
- Tekton pipelines for CI/CD orchestration
- Docker containerization & Kubernetes manifests
- YAML-based IaC with reusable templates

---

## Dev Environment Setup

This was developed in the IBM Skills Network Cloud IDE with OpenShift. To recreate the environment locally:

```bash
source bin/setup.sh
```

This initializes:
- Python 3.9 with `venv`
- Virtual environment activation
- CLI prompts for DevOps workflow

Activate environment:

```bash
source ~/venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

Run PostgreSQL container:

```bash
make db
```

## Local Kubernetes Simulation

To replicate the IBM Cloud IDE locally:

```bash
make cluster      # Start K3D cluster
make tekton       # Install Tekton
make clustertasks # Add IBMâ€™s ClusterTasks
```

Use Docker Desktop + VS Code + Remote Containers for full local experience.
